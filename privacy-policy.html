    <h1>Privacy Policy for Docs SideWriter</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: 04/10/2024</p>
    
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Docs SideWriter ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information about users of our Chrome extension ("the Extension").</p>
    
    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Account Information:</strong> To use the Extension, you may need to grant us access to your Google account through OAuth. This allows us to access specific Google Drive and Google Docs files as authorized by you.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may collect anonymous usage statistics, such as how often features are used, to improve our service.</li>
        <li><strong>No Collection of Personal Information:</strong> The Extension does not collect or store personal information beyond what is required for accessing Google Docs.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Docs Access:</strong> We use the permissions granted by you to add notes to your selected Google Docs files. The data is only processed locally and via Google APIs.</li>
        <li><strong>Improving the Extension:</strong> Usage statistics, if collected, are used to understand and improve the Extension's performance and usability.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>4. Information Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share your personal data with third parties. All Google Docs interactions are performed with the permission you provide via Google OAuth.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable steps to protect your information, including using Google's secure APIs. However, no system is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee the security of your data.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Third-Party Links</h2>
    <p>The Extension may include links to third-party websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites.</p>
    
    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted, and the "Last Updated" date will be modified.</p>
